### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use npm test or yarn test** (the package manager) whenever executing test commands.
- **Tests should use Jest or Vitest** as the testing framework for TypeScript/Node.js projects.

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).



### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

### 📎 Style & Conventions
- **Use Node.js, TypeScript, Crystallize CMS, Remix, and Railway** as the tech stack
- **Follow TypeScript best practices**, use proper type annotations, and format with Prettier.
- **Use ESLint** for code quality and consistency.

- Write **JSDoc comments for every function** using the standard style:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Brief summary.
   * 
   * @param param1 - Description of parameter
   * @returns Description of return value
   */
  function example(param1: string): string {
    return param1;
  }
  ```

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified npm packages and TypeScript/Node.js APIs.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Use npm/yarn for package management** and ensure proper TypeScript configuration.
